## React Js
 React is a JavaScript library for rendering user interfaces (UI). UI is built from small units like buttons, text, and images

 ## Thinking in React
 React can change how you think about the designs you look at and the apps you build. When you build a user interface with React, you will first break it apart into pieces called components. Then, you will describe the different visual states for each of your components
